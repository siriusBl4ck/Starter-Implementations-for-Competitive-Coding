# Starter-Implementations-for-Competitive-Coding
The templates I use when I code competitively. Contains implementations of structures which I wish were implemented a certain way, but STL doesn't have it that way

Generally, it is possible to solely use STL vector to implement graph based data structures and algorithms without making classes. However, it helps me to implement these using classes and structs instead.
I plan to upload my frequently used and referenced bits of code which I need to revise regularly. Happy coding!
